    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold m-6 p-2 border">Var, let and const:</h1>
    <p class=" m-6 border p-2 text-black bg-slate-400 rounded shadow-xl">
        <span class="font-bold text-2xl">v</span>ar variables are function-scoped, which means they can be accessed from
        anywhere within the function in which
        they are declared. They can also be re-declared and updated multiple times. <br>

        <span class="font-bold text-2xl">l</span>et variables are block-scoped, which means they can only be accessed
        from within the block in which they are
        declared. They can be updated, but they cannot be re-declared. <br>

        <span class="font-bold text-2xl">c</span>onst variables are also block-scoped, but they cannot be updated at all
        once they are declared. This makes them
        a good choice for variables that should not be changed, such as constants or configuration values.

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold m-6 p-2 border">Use cases of null and undefined:</h1>
    <p class=" m-6 border p-2 text-black bg-slate-400 rounded shadow-xl">

        The null and undefined values in JavaScript are used to represent the absence of a value. <br>

        - Null is used to represent the intentional absence of a value. For example, you might use null to represent a
        missing user in a database or a non-existent file. <br>
        - Undefined is used to represent the unintentional absence of a value. For example, a variable might be
        undefined
        if it has not been assigned a value yet or if it has been deleted.

    <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold m-6 p-2 border">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
    <p class=" m-6 border p-2 text-black bg-slate-400 rounded shadow-xl">

        REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural
        style for designing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that use HTTP requests to access and manipulate
        data. REST APIs are widely used in the development of modern web applications and services. <br>

        Here are some of the key features of REST APIs:  <br>

        - They use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
        <br>
        - They use URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources.
        <br>
        - They use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language) to encode data.
        <br>
        - They are stateless, which means that each request must contain all of the information necessary to process it.
        <br>
        REST APIs are a popular choice for developers because they are easy to understand and implement. They are also
        scalable and reliable, making them ideal for use in large-scale applications.
